Task ID: migration-verify
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Migrated from previous chat. Verify workspace state; recover from backup repo if wiped.

Work Log:
- Ran verification commands on /home/z/my-project
- Found workspace WIPED: only platform defaults (.env with DATABASE_URL, .gitignore with skills/+node_modules, empty download/, skills/, upload/, .git with single "Initial commit" e956a66)
- page.tsx missing, no remotes configured, 0 animal assets, no worklog
- Cloudflare live site still returning HTTP 200 (immune to platform auto-save, as expected)
- Removed platform's bare .git, ran `git init`, added backup remote, fetched backup/main
- `git reset --hard backup/main` → HEAD at 6f27c14 (correct expected commit)
- Added origin remote pointing to arjundroid12/3d-portfolio.git
- Verified remotes: backup + origin both present and correct
- Ran `npm install` — succeeded with only allow-scripts warnings (expected, harmless)
- Ran `npx next build` — clean, compiled in 8s, 4 static pages generated
- Verified file integrity:
  - src/app/page.tsx = 5148 lines ✅
  - useAchievements present (function def + 1 usage call) ✅
  - public/animals/ = 11 files ✅
- Final live check: https://arjun-portfolio-emc.pages.dev → HTTP 200 ✅

Stage Summary:
- Workspace fully recovered from backup repo (commit 6f27c14)
- Both remotes configured (origin → 3d-portfolio, backup → arjun-portfolio-backup)
- Build passes cleanly, all features intact
- Cloudflare live site unaffected by workspace wipe (still 200)
- Ready to continue work — awaiting user instructions

Task ID: 1
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Add new /experience page linked from an "Experience" button in the nav bar. Use uploaded ZB6YSk.gif as background, wizard.gif as character. Do NOT push to git (user will trigger later).

Work Log:
- Inspected uploaded files: wizard.gif (250x250, 8 frames), ZB6YSk.gif (384x216, 90 frames, 1MB)
- Copied to public/experience/ as wizard.gif and dungeon-bg.gif
- Created src/app/experience/page.tsx (new Next.js App Router route):
  * Full-screen fixed bg using dungeon-bg.gif (opacity 0.55, saturated/darkened)
  * Radial vignette overlay for readability
  * Top bar with "Back to Dungeon" pill link to "/" + "Chamber of Experience" section label
  * Hero: large EXPERIENCE title (Bebas Neue) + intro paragraph + clickable wizard character
  * Wizard: 180x180 image, floats idle, click triggers random sarcastic speech bubble (8 lines)
  * 3 experience entries styled as dungeon loot cards (legendary/epic/rare rarity borders + glow):
    - Techify Inc (Software Management & Marketing, 2024-Present) — legendary
    - VIT Bhopal University B.Tech CSE 4th yr (2022-2026) — epic
    - Independent Builder & Content Creator (2023-Present) — rare
  * Each card: role, org, period, location, summary, tags
  * Footer note: "More quests unlock as Arjun levels up..."
  * Local <style> tag with wizardFloat + wizardBubbleIn keyframes (scoped to this page)
  * Self-contained Web Audio click() function (no shared hook needed)
  * 'use client' for hooks/interactivity
- Wired "Experience" link into main nav bar (src/app/page.tsx):
  * Desktop nav: added as separate <a href="/experience"> after the 4 in-page anchors, styled gold (#fde68a) with glow text-shadow to differentiate from in-page scroll links
  * Mobile hamburger menu: added gold-bordered pill entry above GitHub link, calls setMobileMenuOpen(false) + sound.playClick() on tap
- Verified build: `npx next build` clean, /experience listed as static route (○)
- Verified dev server: GET / → 200, GET /experience → 200, content render check passed (EXPERIENCE title, Back to Dungeon, Chamber of Experience, Techify, both gif refs present)
- Did NOT push to git (per user instruction)

Stage Summary:
- New route /experience live on local dev (http://localhost:3000/experience)
- Nav bar "Experience" button works on both desktop (gold glow link) and mobile (gold pill in hamburger)
- Background and wizard assets in place at /public/experience/
- Build passes, ready to deploy when user gives the go-ahead
- NOT committed/pushed — workspace state is local-only changes on top of commit 6f27c14

Task ID: 3
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Make wizard bigger and fix speech bubble being overlaid by header text.

Work Log:
- Diagnosed overlap: bubble was positioned ABOVE wizard (bottom: calc(100% + 14px))
- Root cause: hero section has zIndex 4, header has zIndex 5 — when bubble extended
  above the wizard into the header's vertical band, the header covered it
- Fix: repositioned bubble to the LEFT of the wizard, vertically centered
  (right: calc(100% + 14px); top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%))
- This keeps the bubble clear of BOTH the header (above) and the "click to talk"
  label (below), and uses the natural empty space to the wizard's left
- Tail moved from bottom to right side of bubble, points right toward wizard
- Wizard image: 240px -> 300px (native GIF is 250, upscaled with imageRendering:
  pixelated which keeps the blocky dungeon aesthetic crisp)
- Bubble maxWidth: 280 -> 300 to match larger wizard
- Updated wizardBubbleIn keyframe: now animates translateX(8px -> 0) with
  translateY(-50%) preserved (was translateY(6px -> 0) for old bottom position)
- Build clean, deployed to Cloudflare (25 new files, 1.75s)
- Committed b532d41, pushed to origin + backup

Stage Summary:
- Wizard now 300px (25% bigger)
- Speech bubble no longer overlaid by header — sits to the left of wizard
- Live at https://arjun-portfolio-emc.pages.dev/experience
- Both repos synced at b532d41

Task ID: 4
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: User noticed wizard GIF has inbuilt padding causing layout issues. Verify and fix.

Work Log:
- Wrote scripts/analyze_wizard_padding.py to inspect each frame's non-transparent bbox
- Finding: GIF is 250x250 but the actual wizard sprite is only 57x104 pixels
  - Padding: L=108, T=63, R=85, B=83 (~75% of the canvas is transparent)
  - The sprite is also shifted RIGHT (108px left padding vs 85px right)
- This explained why scaling up looked weird: the image wasn't getting bigger,
  the padding was. Forced previous attempts to use weird bubble overlap offsets.
- Wrote scripts/crop_wizard.py:
  - Computes union bbox across all 8 frames (with 2px breathing margin)
  - Crops each frame to bbox
  - Re-encodes as animated GIF preserving transparency:
    * Pastes RGBA sprite onto magenta background (color the wizard won't use)
    * Quantizes to 255-color adaptive palette
    * Finds magenta's palette index, marks it as the GIF transparency index
    * disposal=2 (restore to bg) for clean frame transitions
- Result: public/experience/wizard.gif is now 61x108 (down from 250x250), 9KB
  (was 12KB), all 8 frames preserved, transparency intact
- Updated experience/page.tsx:
  - Wizard img: width=200, height=354 (preserves 61:108 native aspect ratio)
  - Reverted bubble to clean 14px gap (right: calc(100% + 14px)) — no overlap
    needed now that the wizard has no padding
  - Hero grid gap back to 32px
- Build clean, deployed to Cloudflare (26 new files)
- Committed 65fee98, pushed to origin + backup

Stage Summary:
- Wizard sprite properly cropped — no more dead padding
- Rendered at 200x354 (natural aspect), looks crisp via image-rendering: pixelated
- Bubble back to clean layout with normal 14px gap
- Both repos synced at 65fee98

Task ID: 5
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: User disliked the appearance of the Contact section cards (flat brown). Redesign.

Work Log:
- VLM-analyzed user's screenshot: showed Contact section on main page with 4 flat
  brown info cards (Email/Phone/GitHub/Location) + central "Have a quest in mind?" CTA
- Located Contact section at src/app/page.tsx:4946
- Old style: Card components with bg-amber-950/60 + border-amber-800/40, flat,
  Sparkles icon directly on card, Button component for CTA
- Redesigned with premium dungeon glassmorphism (kept amber/gold palette):

  Contact info cards:
  * Layered bg: linear-gradient(160deg, rgba(30,20,12,0.85) -> rgba(20,14,8,0.92))
  * backdrop-blur(8px) over dungeon scene
  * Gold border 0.18 -> 0.5 on hover, with 24px gold glow halo
  * Circular 44px icon badges: radial gradient bg + gold border + 18px glow
  * Top accent line (gold gradient, fades at edges)
  * Inner shadow (depth) + outer shadow (elevation)
  * VT323 mono font for values, uppercase tracking for labels

  CTA card:
  * Stronger gold border (0.25), larger padding
  * 120px radial-gradient arcane circle behind Sparkles icon
  * 56px icon badge with 28px glow
  * TrenchSlab heading with gold text-shadow
  * "Send a raven" button: amber->orange->deep-orange gradient pill,
    dark text on bright amber (better contrast than white),
    triple-layer shadow (glow + drop + inner highlight)
  * Hover: button lifts 2px, glow intensifies

- Build clean, deployed to Cloudflare (26 new files)
- Committed 4e3bee5, pushed to origin + backup

Stage Summary:
- Contact section cards completely restyled — no more flat brown boxes
- Premium dungeon glass look with gold glow accents
- Live at https://arjun-portfolio-emc.pages.dev (scroll to Contact)
- Both repos synced at 4e3bee5

Task ID: 6
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: User disliked About section appearance too. Redesign to match new premium style.

Work Log:
- VLM-analyzed screenshot: About section with intro (left) + Skills panel (right)
  with flat brown skill tags (bg-amber-900/30 border-amber-700/40)
- Located About section at src/app/page.tsx:4874
- Redesigned with matching glassmorphism (consistent with Contact redesign):

  Intro card (left):
  * Glass card: linear-gradient bg + gold border 0.2 + blur(8px) + 3-layer shadow
  * Top accent line (gold gradient, fades at edges)
  * Heading: TrenchSlab font + circular 36px icon badge (👋 emoji on radial
    gradient + gold border + 16px glow)
  * Body text: 15px, lineHeight 1.7, gold highlights for key terms
  * Updated "Techify Inc." -> "AIOrders x Foodswipe" (matches experience page
    and user's actual role)

  Skills card (right):
  * Matching glass card
  * 🛠️ icon badge in heading
  * Category headers: glowing gold dot (6px, 8px glow) + VT323 uppercase label
    + trailing accent line fading right (was: bare amber text)
  * Skill tags fully restyled:
    - Was: flat brown bg-amber-900/30 rectangles, rounded-lg
    - Now: subtle gold-tinted pills (rgba(250,204,21,0.06) bg, gold border 0.25,
      borderRadius 999px = full pill shape)
    - VT323 mono font, gold text
    - Hover: bg 0.06->0.14, border 0.25->0.55, adds 14px gold glow halo
    - Lifts 2px on hover (Framer Motion whileHover)

- Build clean, deployed to Cloudflare (26 new files)
- Committed 888eb26, pushed to origin + backup

Stage Summary:
- About section now matches Contact section's premium dungeon glass aesthetic
- Skill tags are pills with gold glow instead of flat brown boxes
- Both cards visually balanced (matching glass style, icon badges in headings)
- Techify Inc. reference corrected to AIOrders x Foodswipe
- Live at https://arjun-portfolio-emc.pages.dev (scroll to About)
- Both repos synced at 888eb26

  features = topology view + CLI + web dashboard + REST API + tests/CI,
  deliverable = code + README, deadline = course-grade, new GitHub repo, link to portfolio later
- Created /home/z/my-project/sdn-project/ with full structure (12 directories)
- Wrote p4/basic_forwarding.p4 — P4-16 program for BMv2 with L2 forward, ACL, L3 route tables
- Wrote controller/ Ryu app (5 modules):
  * topology.py — TopologyManager singleton, thread-safe, Switch/Host/Link dataclasses
  * forwarding.py — reactive L2 forwarding, BFS shortest path, bidirectional flow install
  * rest_api.py — Flask REST API (10 endpoints: topology/switches/hosts/links/flows/stats/health/version)
  * dashboard.py — Flask blueprint serving the web SPA at /
  * main.py — Ryu app entry with deferred imports (works without Ryu installed)
- Wrote mininet/topology.py — 4-switch ring+chord topology, CLI args, runs with sudo
- Wrote cli/sdnctl.py — full CLI: topology/switches/switch/hosts/links/flows/install-flow/delete-flow/stats/health/version

- Wrote tests/ — 46 tests covering topology, forwarding, REST API, CLI
- Fixed bugs during testing:
  * dataclass field ordering (non-default fields must come before default)
  * deferred Ryu imports in forwarding.py (was failing at module load)
  * escaped backslash in test docstring (SyntaxWarning)
  * monkeypatch forwarding.topology in path tests (was using global singleton)
- All 46 tests passing in 0.49s

Task ID: 8
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Implement DDoS detection for SDN project + add it as a portfolio project card.

Work Log:
SDN project (https://github.com/arjundroid12/sdn-project):
- Wrote controller/security.py — DDoSDetector class with:
  * Threshold detection (block source after N packets in window)
  * Entropy detection (block source after N distinct dst MACs)
  * Sliding window sample expiry (no memory leak)
  * Auto-unblock after block_duration
  * Manual block/unblock via REST API
  * Thread-safe, background daemon thread
  * Block/unblock callbacks push ACL flows to all connected switches
- Wired into controller/main.py:

  * Packet-in handler feeds samples to detector (never blocks forwarding)
  * ACL drop flow: priority=200, eth_src match, no actions = drop
- Added 6 new /api/v1/security/* endpoints to rest_api.py:
  * GET /security/blocked, GET /security/blocked/{mac}/status
  * POST /security/blocked/{mac}, DELETE /security/blocked/{mac}
  * GET /security/stats, PUT /security/config
- Wrote tests/test_security.py — 20 new tests covering:
  * Sample ingestion (broadcast/null src filtering)
  * Threshold + entropy detection (block + no-block cases)
  * Window expiry
  * Manual block/unblock (idempotency, callback invocation)
  * Auto-unblock after block_duration
  * Stats reporting + thread lifecycle
- Fixed bugs: _detect_anomalies signature, test import typo, auto-unblock test
- All 66 tests passing in 2.72s (was 46)
