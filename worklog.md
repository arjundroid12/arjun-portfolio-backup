# Worklog — Arjun's Dungeon Portfolio

Task ID: migration-verify
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Migrated from previous chat. Verify workspace state; recover from backup repo if wiped.

Work Log:
- Ran verification commands on /home/z/my-project
- Found workspace WIPED: only platform defaults (.env with DATABASE_URL, .gitignore with skills/+node_modules, empty download/, skills/, upload/, .git with single "Initial commit" e956a66)
- page.tsx missing, no remotes configured, 0 animal assets, no worklog
- Cloudflare live site still returning HTTP 200 (immune to platform auto-save, as expected)
- Removed platform's bare .git, ran `git init`, added backup remote, fetched backup/main
- `git reset --hard backup/main` → HEAD at 6f27c14 (correct expected commit)
- Added origin remote pointing to arjundroid12/3d-portfolio.git
- Verified remotes: backup + origin both present and correct
- Ran `npm install` — succeeded with only allow-scripts warnings (expected, harmless)
- Ran `npx next build` — clean, compiled in 8s, 4 static pages generated
- Verified file integrity:
  - src/app/page.tsx = 5148 lines ✅
  - useAchievements present (function def + 1 usage call) ✅
  - public/animals/ = 11 files ✅
- Final live check: https://arjun-portfolio-emc.pages.dev → HTTP 200 ✅

Stage Summary:
- Workspace fully recovered from backup repo (commit 6f27c14)
- Both remotes configured (origin → 3d-portfolio, backup → arjun-portfolio-backup)
- Build passes cleanly, all features intact
- Cloudflare live site unaffected by workspace wipe (still 200)
- Ready to continue work — awaiting user instructions

Task ID: 1
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Add new /experience page linked from an "Experience" button in the nav bar. Use uploaded ZB6YSk.gif as background, wizard.gif as character. Do NOT push to git (user will trigger later).

Work Log:
- Inspected uploaded files: wizard.gif (250x250, 8 frames), ZB6YSk.gif (384x216, 90 frames, 1MB)
- Copied to public/experience/ as wizard.gif and dungeon-bg.gif
- Created src/app/experience/page.tsx (new Next.js App Router route):
  * Full-screen fixed bg using dungeon-bg.gif (opacity 0.55, saturated/darkened)
  * Radial vignette overlay for readability
  * Top bar with "Back to Dungeon" pill link to "/" + "Chamber of Experience" section label
  * Hero: large EXPERIENCE title (Bebas Neue) + intro paragraph + clickable wizard character
  * Wizard: 180x180 image, floats idle, click triggers random sarcastic speech bubble (8 lines)
  * 3 experience entries styled as dungeon loot cards (legendary/epic/rare rarity borders + glow):
    - Techify Inc (Software Management & Marketing, 2024-Present) — legendary
    - VIT Bhopal University B.Tech CSE 4th yr (2022-2026) — epic
    - Independent Builder & Content Creator (2023-Present) — rare
  * Each card: role, org, period, location, summary, tags
  * Footer note: "More quests unlock as Arjun levels up..."
  * Local <style> tag with wizardFloat + wizardBubbleIn keyframes (scoped to this page)
  * Self-contained Web Audio click() function (no shared hook needed)
  * 'use client' for hooks/interactivity
- Wired "Experience" link into main nav bar (src/app/page.tsx):
  * Desktop nav: added as separate <a href="/experience"> after the 4 in-page anchors, styled gold (#fde68a) with glow text-shadow to differentiate from in-page scroll links
  * Mobile hamburger menu: added gold-bordered pill entry above GitHub link, calls setMobileMenuOpen(false) + sound.playClick() on tap
- Verified build: `npx next build` clean, /experience listed as static route (○)
- Verified dev server: GET / → 200, GET /experience → 200, content render check passed (EXPERIENCE title, Back to Dungeon, Chamber of Experience, Techify, both gif refs present)
- Did NOT push to git (per user instruction)

Stage Summary:
- New route /experience live on local dev (http://localhost:3000/experience)
- Nav bar "Experience" button works on both desktop (gold glow link) and mobile (gold pill in hamburger)
- Background and wizard assets in place at /public/experience/
- Build passes, ready to deploy when user gives the go-ahead
- NOT committed/pushed — workspace state is local-only changes on top of commit 6f27c14

Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Shorten Goddess's long chat responses (short/sarcastic/funny), add more FUN_MESSAGES, deploy to Cloudflare, push to both repos.

Work Log:
- Located FUN_MESSAGES (98 entries) and AIChatWidget getResponse() function (40+ topics, many long responses)
- Rewrote 30+ Goddess chat responses from paragraphs to punchy one-liners (15-25 words each):
  * Projects, agents, skills, contact, education, resume, github, about, hobbies, sound, planets, website, thanks (array), compliments, who-are-you, joke, help, bye, salary, age, location, king, torches, treasure, cave, wheel, transition, boss, rpg, achievements, fonts, splash, mobile, deploy, lenis, framer motion, ugly roast, love, secret, future, vocalist
- Added 34 new short FUN_MESSAGES (98 -> 132 total) — sarcasm, fourth-wall breaks, dungeon flavor, dev jokes
- Updated experience entry to "Website Management & Marketing Head" at AIOrders x Foodswipe
- Verified build: npx next build clean, page.tsx now 5220 lines
- Deployed to Cloudflare Pages:
  * 34 new files uploaded (164 already cached), 2.56 sec
  * Deploy URL: https://26bc9ff5.arjun-portfolio-emc.pages.dev
  * Live site + /experience both return HTTP 200
- Committed: 8d4b4c4 "feat: add /experience page, bigger wizard, short sarcastic Goddess dialogs, +34 FUN_MESSAGES"
- Pushed to origin (3d-portfolio): 6f27c14..8d4b4c4 main -> main ✓
- Pushed to backup (arjun-portfolio-backup): 6f27c14..8d4b4c4 main -> main ✓

Stage Summary:
- Live site updated: https://arjun-portfolio-emc.pages.dev (home) + /experience
- Goddess now speaks in punchy one-liners instead of paragraphs

Task ID: 3
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: Make wizard bigger and fix speech bubble being overlaid by header text.

Work Log:
- Diagnosed overlap: bubble was positioned ABOVE wizard (bottom: calc(100% + 14px))
- Root cause: hero section has zIndex 4, header has zIndex 5 — when bubble extended
  above the wizard into the header's vertical band, the header covered it
- Fix: repositioned bubble to the LEFT of the wizard, vertically centered
  (right: calc(100% + 14px); top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%))
- This keeps the bubble clear of BOTH the header (above) and the "click to talk"
  label (below), and uses the natural empty space to the wizard's left
- Tail moved from bottom to right side of bubble, points right toward wizard
- Wizard image: 240px -> 300px (native GIF is 250, upscaled with imageRendering:
  pixelated which keeps the blocky dungeon aesthetic crisp)
- Bubble maxWidth: 280 -> 300 to match larger wizard
- Updated wizardBubbleIn keyframe: now animates translateX(8px -> 0) with
  translateY(-50%) preserved (was translateY(6px -> 0) for old bottom position)
- Build clean, deployed to Cloudflare (25 new files, 1.75s)
- Committed b532d41, pushed to origin + backup

Stage Summary:
- Wizard now 300px (25% bigger)
- Speech bubble no longer overlaid by header — sits to the left of wizard
- Live at https://arjun-portfolio-emc.pages.dev/experience
- Both repos synced at b532d41

Task ID: 4
Agent: main (Super Z)
Task: User noticed wizard GIF has inbuilt padding causing layout issues. Verify and fix.

Work Log:
- Wrote scripts/analyze_wizard_padding.py to inspect each frame's non-transparent bbox
- Finding: GIF is 250x250 but the actual wizard sprite is only 57x104 pixels
  - Padding: L=108, T=63, R=85, B=83 (~75% of the canvas is transparent)
  - The sprite is also shifted RIGHT (108px left padding vs 85px right)
- This explained why scaling up looked weird: the image wasn't getting bigger,
  the padding was. Forced previous attempts to use weird bubble overlap offsets.
- Wrote scripts/crop_wizard.py:
  - Computes union bbox across all 8 frames (with 2px breathing margin)
  - Crops each frame to bbox
  - Re-encodes as animated GIF preserving transparency:
    * Pastes RGBA sprite onto magenta background (color the wizard won't use)
    * Quantizes to 255-color adaptive palette
    * Finds magenta's palette index, marks it as the GIF transparency index
    * disposal=2 (restore to bg) for clean frame transitions
- Result: public/experience/wizard.gif is now 61x108 (down from 250x250), 9KB
  (was 12KB), all 8 frames preserved, transparency intact
- Updated experience/page.tsx:
  - Wizard img: width=200, height=354 (preserves 61:108 native aspect ratio)
  - Reverted bubble to clean 14px gap (right: calc(100% + 14px)) — no overlap
    needed now that the wizard has no padding
  - Hero grid gap back to 32px
- Build clean, deployed to Cloudflare (26 new files)
- Committed 65fee98, pushed to origin + backup

Stage Summary:
- Wizard sprite properly cropped — no more dead padding
- Rendered at 200x354 (natural aspect), looks crisp via image-rendering: pixelated
- Bubble back to clean layout with normal 14px gap
- Both repos synced at 65fee98
